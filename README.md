# Global Air Quality EDA and Insight _ P4DS_22KHDL

## Overview
This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to global air quality. The goal is to gain insights into air pollution levels, identify trends, and answer key questions that can inform environmental policies and public awareness.

## Motivation
Air pollution is a major environmental issue that affects the health and well-being of millions of people globally. This project aims to analyze air quality data to understand pollution patterns and provide insights that can help mitigate its impact.

```

### 3. Running the Notebook

Once you have opened the relevant notebook, you can run the cells step by step by selecting a cell and pressing `Shift + Enter` or by using the `Run` button in the toolbar.

Make sure to run all the necessary cells in order (from top to bottom) to ensure that the data is loaded, processed, and visualized correctly. The notebooks are organized as follows:

1. **[Collecting Data](notebooks/1-collecting_data.ipynb)**: This notebook covers the steps for collecting and loading the dataset.
2. **[Exploring Data](notebooks/2-eda_data.ipynb)**: This notebook explores the dataset through various visualizations and analyses.
3. **[Questions](notebooks/3-question_analyzing.ipynb)**: This notebook focuses on answering the key questions based on the data analysis.
4. **[Challenges, Lessons and Future Development](notebooks/4-challenge_and_development.ipynb)**: This notebook discusses the challenges faced, lessons learned, and future directions for the project.

Ensure you follow the order of notebooks as specified to maintain the correct flow of the project.
