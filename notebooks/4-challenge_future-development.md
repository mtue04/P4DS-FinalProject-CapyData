# Global Air Quality Analysis - Project Reflection

## 1. Challenges Faced

### Cao Hoàng Lộc:
- Lack of Seasonality: The absence of cyclical patterns made it difficult to identify recurring trends in air quality and weather data.
- Visualization Challenges: The complexity and lack of clear patterns made it hard to create effective visualizations for understanding relationships between variables.
- Limited Understanding of Air Pollution: A lack of domain knowledge made it challenging to interpret results and select relevant features for the model.

### Phan Võ Minh Tuệ:
- Difficulty in accessing consistent and reliable air quality datasets from various regions.
- Managing time effectively between different phases of the project.
- The selected data lacked continuous time series for 2023, resulting in difficulties identifying cycles.
- Formulating meaningful and valuable questions without ambiguity. Ensuring these questions are backed by scientific articles or phenomena-based reports to explain the results.
- Lack of proficiency in using Git and GitHub, which affected workflow efficiency.

### Phạm Anh Văn:
- Difficulty in Extracting Insights from Data because of the familiarity and similarity of AQI trends across different years and cities, making it hard to distinguish unique characteristics or anomalies.
- Visualization Challenges: hard to differential insight between cities, features,... due to its familiarity and the lack of skills of chart's selection.

## 2. Lessons Learned

### Cao Hoàng Lộc:
- Exposure to Time Series Data: Gained experience working with time series data, improving understanding of temporal patterns and trends.
- Asking the Right Questions: Learned how to ask the right questions to uncover valuable insights from the dataset.
- Basic Preprocessing Skills: Gained knowledge of essential preprocessing techniques, such as handling missing data, normalization, and feature selection.

### Phan Võ Minh Tuệ:
- Enhanced proficiency in using Python libraries for data analysis, such as Pandas and Matplotlib.
- Learned how to identify and address common data anomalies.
- Improved teamwork skills and gained better understanding of team members' personalities, which will benefit collaboration in future projects.

### Phạm Anh Văn:
- The Value of Understanding dataset as its data types and data's insights.
- The importance of preprocessing: well preprocessing, including handling outliers, imputing missing values, ... significantly improves the effective in further Data Science process

## 3. Improvements and Future Development

- Enhance time series analysis to uncover trends, seasonality, and anomalies in air quality and weather data.
- Develop predictive models to forecast air quality and weather conditions, enabling proactive pollution management.
- Source high-quality, continuous time-series datasets, particularly for 2023, to improve analysis accuracy.
- Conduct in-depth analysis of specific pollutants and their health impacts.
- Incorporate real-time data streams for dynamic insights and integrate forecasting models to predict air quality trends effectively.
